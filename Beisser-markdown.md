Voiceover: In the past month there have been rumors about women being kidnapped and trafficked in Blacksburg. People were talking about a couple who followed women, broke into their homes, and began to use these women for sex trafficking. Several instances of girls being chased into their apartments at different apartment complexes only made the information more disturbing.
